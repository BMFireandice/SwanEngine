This was created as a Junior Project, don't take it too serious ;)

The scope of this project was to create a search engine primarily for research purposes. This search engine will have 
a searching function based on Google Scholarly's website database. It will return the same results as Google Scholarly,
but it will be displayed in a more comfortable manner.
